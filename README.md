## Overview
City Explorers is an app that given a location will display where that location is on a map, what the 8 day forecast is for that location, the best places to eat according to Yelp, movies that are showing, and places to go hiking. It provides all the information you need if you are interested in visiting a location but don't know what to do there and what the weather will be like.

## Getting Started
To use this app, simply put in your server location. That will take you to a page where you can enter any location you wish and the data from that location will appear.

## Architecture
This application was designed using HTML, CSS, javaScript, and Node.js. It also includes a jQuery library.

## Change Log

10-24-2018 11:48 - Application now populates both the map and the weather from API calls

10-25-2018 1:00 - Creted the Table Schemas

10-26-2018 10:13am - Location, Weather, Yelp and Movies are all working with functioning databases
